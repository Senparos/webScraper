After 20 years, this scientist uncovered the physics behind the spiral pass
Experimental atomic physicist Tim Gay successfully uncovered the physics behind the spiral pass after two decades of hobby research. Through collaboration with two other physicists and extensive theoretical calculations and computer simulations, Gay explained how the concept of gyroscopic precession plays a crucial role in the football's rotation during a pass.
Why wolves are thriving in this radioactive zone
Following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, gray wolves have thrived in the radioactive zone of northern Ukraine and Belarus despite human evacuation. Scientists are researching whether the wolves are genetically resilient to cancer or simply flourishing due to lack of human interference. Collaboration between wildlife and cancer researchers on this phenomenon is being explored.
FDA move to ban formaldehyde in hair straighteners called too little, too late
The article discusses Rep. Shontel Brown's call for further FDA investigations into banning formaldehyde in hair straighteners, which has been linked to health risks. Critics argue the FDA's proposal falls short, as other harmful ingredients pose risks to Black women. Reps. Pressley and Brown urge FDA action on hair products linked to hormone-related cancers.
Another atmospheric river has soaked California. What role has climate change played?
An atmospheric river has caused havoc in California, leading to landslides, power outages, and three storm-related deaths. The intensity of recent atmospheric rivers in California is likely influenced by human-caused climate change, with warmer oceans and increased moisture capacity in the atmosphere contributing to more severe precipitation events.
Gardeners can now grow a genetically modified purple tomato made with snapdragon DNA
Norfolk Plant Sciences has introduced the Purple Tomato, a genetically modified crop with snapdragon DNA, rich in anthocyanins for health benefits. It aims to change consumer perceptions of GMOs by offering the seeds to home gardeners in the U.S., emphasizing taste and nutrition. The Purple Tomato is part of the trend towards nutrient-dense GMOs, contrasting with earlier GMO crops like herbicide-tolerant soybeans and corn, to promote sustainability and healthier agriculture practices.
Negative leap second: Climate change delays unusual step for time standard
Climate change has slowed the Earth's rotation, leading to the possibility of a negative leap second being needed. This unprecedented action could impact modern technology reliant on precise timekeeping. Despite the potential challenges, experts aim to prevent unnecessary risks and find alternative solutions.
Milky Way black hole has 'strong, twisted' magnetic field in mesmerizing new image
For the first time, an image of the Sagittarius A* black hole in polarized light reveals a "strong, twisted" magnetic field in spiral form at the Milky Way's center. This detailed image provides new insights into the black hole's magnetic structure and the role of magnetic fields in its interactions with surrounding gas and matter. The Event Horizon Telescope collaboration captured this mesmerizing image, highlighting similarities with the larger M87* black hole. Despite its powerful effects, Sagittarius A* appears to be rapidly evolving, posing challenges for observation.
The physical sensations of watching a total solar eclipse
Science writer David Baron shares his experience of witnessing a total solar eclipse, describing it as a surreal and otherworldly event where the sky suddenly changes and unique sensations like temperature drops and unusual lighting effects occur. Baron emphasizes the transformative experience of seeing the solar corona during totality, stating that it is a sight not to be missed.
Here's what to know about dengue, as Puerto Rico declares a public health emergency
Puerto Rico has declared a public health emergency due to a rapid increase in dengue cases. Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease affecting millions globally annually. Prevention includes using insect repellents, wearing protective clothing, and eliminating standing water to prevent mosquito breeding. Dengue can lead to severe illness and, rarely, be fatal.
The Colorado River rarely reaches the sea. Here's why
The Colorado River historically ran to the sea but now rarely reaches the gulf due to dams and canals diverting water for human consumption and agriculture. A study analyzed water usage over two decades, finding irrigation for cattle feed to be the largest consumer. Negotiations are ongoing for future water sharing.
