Gardeners can now grow a genetically modified purple tomato made with snapdragon DNA
Norfolk Plant Sciences has introduced the Purple Tomato, a genetically modified crop with snapdragon DNA, rich in anthocyanins for health benefits. It aims to change consumer perceptions of GMOs by offering the seeds to home gardeners in the U.S., emphasizing taste and nutrition. The Purple Tomato is part of the trend towards nutrient-dense GMOs, contrasting with earlier GMO crops like herbicide-tolerant soybeans and corn, to promote sustainability and healthier agriculture practices.
