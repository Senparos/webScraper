After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in 1986, humans evacuated surrounding areas due to radioactive risks, but gray wolves remained. Their population in northern Ukraine and Belarus has since thrived, leading scientists to investigate whether they are genetically resistant to cancer or benefitting from lack of human interference. Researchers are eager to collaborate with them in understanding cancer resilience.
