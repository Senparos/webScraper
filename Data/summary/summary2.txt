Why wolves are thriving in this radioactive zone
Following the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, gray wolves have thrived in the radioactive zone of northern Ukraine and Belarus despite human evacuation. Scientists are researching whether the wolves are genetically resilient to cancer or simply flourishing due to lack of human interference. Collaboration between wildlife and cancer researchers on this phenomenon is being explored.
