After 20 years, this scientist uncovered the physics behind the spiral pass
Experimental atomic physicist Tim Gay successfully uncovered the physics behind the spiral pass after two decades of hobby research. Through collaboration with two other physicists and extensive theoretical calculations and computer simulations, Gay explained how the concept of gyroscopic precession plays a crucial role in the football's rotation during a pass.
