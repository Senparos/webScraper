Experimental atomic physicist Tim Gay spent 20 years researching the physics behind the tight spiral pass in football. He discovered that gyroscopic precession explains why the football tilts down in flight, not air resistance or the football acting like a spinning top. This breakthrough came after collaboration with two other physicists and extensive theoretical calculations and simulations.
