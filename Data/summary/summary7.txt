For the first time, a polarized light image reveals the "strong, twisted" magnetic field surrounding the Sagittarius A* black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Scientists describe the magnetic field as a striking spiral structure and compare it to the black hole being like a doughnut with swirls. The image offers a new perspective and understanding of the black hole's dynamics.
