Milky Way black hole has 'strong, twisted' magnetic field in mesmerizing new image
For the first time, an image of the Sagittarius A* black hole in polarized light reveals a "strong, twisted" magnetic field in spiral form at the Milky Way's center. This detailed image provides new insights into the black hole's magnetic structure and the role of magnetic fields in its interactions with surrounding gas and matter. The Event Horizon Telescope collaboration captured this mesmerizing image, highlighting similarities with the larger M87* black hole. Despite its powerful effects, Sagittarius A* appears to be rapidly evolving, posing challenges for observation.
